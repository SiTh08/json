# Libraries, Packages

This class will cover what is in the title.

### Definitions 

#### Libraries 

These built into python/standard in python.
You need to import them to use. 
These are still consider vanilla python.

#### Modules

These are internal and you import them to use else where in the code. 
We build lots of them in OOP, but they can also be functional.

#### Packages 

These are external and need to be installed. 
You can install them using PIP or using Pycharm. 

Pycharm creates it's own virtual environment (VE) to avoid cross contamination.
